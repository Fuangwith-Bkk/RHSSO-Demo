## 9. Roles
RHSSO can be centrailized authorization for your applications. Let's try to add `Role` into RHSSO.

In the `js-console` app: 
- There is no role infomation in the ID Token.
- There are 2 default roles in Access Token
  - `offline_access`
  - `uma_authorization`

In RHSSO Admin Console
- Go to `Roles` --> `Add Role`
- Role Name: `user` 
- and `Save`
- repeat previous step for creating `admin` role

If your refresh ID and Access Tokens in the `js-console` app, It still dont have `user` and `admin` roles in both tokens.

In RHSSO Admin Console
- Go to `users` --> `fuangwit`
- `Role Mappings` tab
  - Add both `admin` and `user` roles 
  
In the `js-console` app
- click `Refresh`
- click `Access Token JSON`
  - You will see `admin`, `user`, `offline_access`, and `uma_authorization` roles are in `roles` attribute

But normally the application just need only related roles that defined in the application. Let's remove `offline_access` and  `uma_authorization` role from Access Token.

In the RHSSO Admin Console
- Go to `Clients` --> `js-console`
- click on `Scope` tab
- The `Full Scope Allowed` is `ON` means we allows all roles for `js-console` client
- Set `Full Scope Allowed` is `OFF` and then select:
  - `admin` and `user` in Available Roles
  - click on `Add Selected`
  
Back to the `js-console` app
- Refresh ID and Access Token
- click on `Access Token JSON`
- You will see only `admin` and `user` are in `roles` attribute
