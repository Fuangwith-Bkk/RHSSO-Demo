## 7. User Attibutes
In RHSSO Admin Console
- Users --> View all users --> select `fuangwit` user
- Go to `Attributes` tab
- Add new attribute
  - Key: `avatar_url`
  - Value: `https://cdn2.iconfinder.com/data/icons/avatars-99/62/avatar-370-456322-512.png`
  - click on `Add` button then click `Save`

if you back to the `js-console` app and refresh for getting new tokens, the both ID and Access tokens are still no `avatar_url` because we didn't add client scope yet. 
So, we need to create the `Client Scope` and then assign to `js-console` app.
- In RHSSO Admin Console
- Go to `Client Scopes` --> `create`
  - Name: `my_scope`
  - and then `Save`
  - click on `Mappers` tab --> `Create`
    - Name: `avatar_url` as name of the mapper
    - Mapper Type: `User Attribute`
    - User Attribute: `avatar_url` to link to `avatar_url` attribute in user account.
    - Token Claim Name: `avatar_url` as name of attribute in Tokens
    - Claim JSON Type: `String`
    - ID Token: `ON` and Access Token: `OFF`
    - click on `Save` button
- Go to `Clients` main menu --> choose `js-console`
  - click on `Client Scopes` tab you will see `my_scope` shows in Available Client Scopes list.
  - select `my_scope` and then `Add selected`
- Go to `js-console` app
  - click `Refresh`
  - User profile will show `js-console` app
  - find out `avatar_url` in ID and Access Token
    - the `avatar_url` will be in only ID Token
  
## 8. Require consent for the application
Sometime the customer may require consent from their end users for processing their information. You could enable `Consent Required` in RHSSO for asking consent from the end users before processing.
- In RHSSO Admin Console
- Go to `js-console` client --> `Settings` tab
  - Consent Required: `ON`
  - `Save`
- Back to the `js-console` application
  - `Logout` and `Login` again
  - RHSSO will ask you for grant privileges to access user attributes include `my_scope`
  - But if we show `my_scope` in the content screen, the end user will question what is `my_scope`? 
- Back to RHSSO Admin Console
  - Go to `Client Scopes` --> `my_scope`
    - Consent Screen Text: `User Photo`
    - `Save`
- Back to the `js-console` app and then refresh the browser.
  - `my_scope` was changed to `User Photo` 
  - click `Yes` to consent and continue login

To avoid RHSSO always asking for consent, you could turn on `Consent Required`.
