## 10. Groups
Normally, we do not assign users to application one by one but we assign user to `group` instead because it's easier to manage.

In RHSSO Admin Console
- Go to `Users` --> `fuangwit` 
  - click on `Role Mapping` tab
  - remove all roles from `Assigned Roles`

Go back to the `js-console` app
- Refresh ID and Access Token
- There is no `roles` attribute in Acess Token

Back to RHSSO Admin Console
- Go to `Groups` --> `New`
  - Name: `groupOfAdmins`
  - click `Save`
  - click on `Role Mapping`
  - add `admin` to Assigned Role
  - repeat previous steps for creating `groupOfUsers`
  - add `user` to Assigned Role for `groupOfUsers`
- Go to `Users` --> `fuangwit`
  - click on `Groups` tab
  - select `groupOfUsers` and `groupOfAdmins` 
  - click `Join`
  
In the `js-console` app
- Refresh ID and Access Token
- click on `Access Token JSON`
- You will see only `admin` and `user` are in `roles` attribute


In many cases, we would like to bind user attribute with `Group` not `User`. It's very useful when we assign user to `Group` and the user automatic get additional attributes from the group .

In RHSSO Admin Console
- Go to `Groups` --> `groupOfUsers` --> `Edit`
- click on `Attributes` tab
- Add
  - Key: `user_type`
  - Value: `regular user`
  - click `Add` and then `Save`
- Go to `Client Scopes` in main menu --> `my_scope`
  - click on `Mappers` tab
  - click on `Create`
    - Name: `user_type`
    - Mapper Type: `User Attribute`
    - User Attribute: `user_type`
    - Token Claim Name: `user_type`
    - Claim JSON Type: `String`
    - then `Save`
  
Back to the `js-console` app
- Refresh ID and Access Token
- click on `Access Token JSON`
- You will see new attribute `user_type`
- click on `ID Token JSON`
- You will see new attribute `user_type` as well
