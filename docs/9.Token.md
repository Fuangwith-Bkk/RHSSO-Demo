## 14. Token & Key

In the `js-console` app
- click on `ID Token` to see raw token
- Copy raw `ID Token` to decode in `jwt.io`
- Explain structure of JWT
  - Header
  - Payload
  - and Verify Signature
- Try to change some character in jwt 
  - jwt.io will alert `Invalid Signature`
  

Go RHSSO Token Validator 
- http://localhost:8080/auth/realms/rhsso/jwt
- Paste raw `ID Token` and then `submit`
- The validator will verify key with RHSSO server
  - show `Token is valid - Singed with active key` message
  - In header part
    - JWT using `RS256` algorithm
    - and signed by using Key Identifier (kid) ....
  
### Change Default Signature Algorithm
In RHSSO Admin Console
- Go to `Realm Settings` --> `Tokens`
  - Default Signature Algorithm: `ES256`
  - click `Save`
  
Back to the `js-console` app
- Refresh ID and Access Token
- Copy new raw `ID Token` to paste and submit in the Token Validator
- You will see signature algorithm is changed from `RS256` to `ES256`
- Copy `kid` value

Switch to the RHSSO Admin Console
- Go to `Realm Setting` --> `Keys`
  - Ctrl+F for searching copied `kid`
  - It will match with `ES256` algorithm
  - Click on `Providers` tab
    - click `Add keystore...` --> `ecdsa-generated`
      - Console Display Name: `ecdsa-generated-new`
      - Priority: `50`
      - click `Save`
  - Click on `Active` tab
    - There are 2 `kid` for `ES256`

Back to the `js-console` app
- Refresh ID and Access Token
- Copy new raw `ID Token` to paste and submit in the Token Validator
- The `alg` in header is still `ES256` but the `kid` is changed to `kid` of `ecdsa-generated-new` 
- Copy `kid`


Switch to the RHSSO Admin Console
- Go to `Realm Setting` --> `Keys`
  - Ctrl+F for searching copied `kid`
  - New `kid` will match with the `kid` of `ecdsa-generated-new` because the `ecdsa-generated-new` is higher priority than previous `kid`
  - click on `ecdsa-generated-new`
    - Active: `OFF`
    - `Save`

Go RHSSO Token Validator 
- click `Submit` again (still use previous raw ID Token)
- message will be changed to `Token is valid - Signed with passive key`

Note: Token was singed by passive key is still valid but the passive key will be not use for the signed new token.

Switch to the RHSSO Admin Console
- Go to `Realm Setting` --> `Keys` --> `Passive`
  - click on `ecdsa-generated-new`
      - Enable: `OFF`
      - `Save`

Go RHSSO Token Validator 
- click `Submit` again (still use previous raw ID Token)
- message will be changed to `Invalid Token - Key not found` because the `ecdsa-generated-new` was disabled.
